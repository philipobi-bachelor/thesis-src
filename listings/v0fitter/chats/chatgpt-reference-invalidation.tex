\textbf{Prompt:} c++ is a reference to a object member invalidated when the member changes?

In C++ a reference, once bound, always refers to the very same object (or sub-object) for its entire lifetime. Simply mutating that object (or its member) does **not** “invalidate” the reference. What *can* invalidate a reference (or pointer) is:

1. **End of lifetime**\
   If the object (or its containing sub‐object) is destroyed, any references to it become dangling.

2. **Relocation**\
   If the object's storage is moved in memory (for example, elements of a `std::vector` being reallocated when you insert past its capacity), then references (and pointers or iterators) to those elements no longer point to the original storage and are therefore invalid.
