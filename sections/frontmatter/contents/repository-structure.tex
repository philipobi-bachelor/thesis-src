I have organized all code and supplementary materials developed during this thesis into topic-specific repositories, including the LaTeX source code for this document itself.

Throughout this work, I reference these repositories in footnotes to provide access to exact implementations, additional documentation, and extended reading materials.

For brevity, repository links are displayed in the shortened format \uline{github/philipobi-bachelor/\textless repository path\textgreater}, which corresponds to the full URL \uline{https://github.com/philipobi-bachelor/\textless repository path\textgreater}.

In digital versions of this thesis, these links are clickable and direct readers to the specific resources.
Additionally, a unified repository at
\href{
    https://gitlab.physik.uni-muenchen.de/agkuhr-bachelors-2025/philipobi-ai-software-optimization
}{https://gitlab.physik.uni-muenchen.de/\allowbreak agkuhr-bachelors-2025/\allowbreak philipobi-ai-software-optimization} 
contains all relevant repositories as submodules.

Clicking on any top-level element in this unified repository automatically redirects to the corresponding specific repository.
